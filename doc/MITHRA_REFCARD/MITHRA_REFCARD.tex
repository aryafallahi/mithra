\chapter{Reference Card}
\label{chapter_refcard}

In the following, a general format for the input file of MITHRA is presented. The red icons or groups can be repeated in the text. \emph{int} stands for an integer number, \emph{real} represents a real value, and \emph{string} denotes a string of characters. The reference directory in the path locations is the path where the simulation is started. In other words, ``.\,/\," points to the location where the project is called.
